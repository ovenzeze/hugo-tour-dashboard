# Podcast Cover Generation Style Guide

This guide defines the visual style, technical specifications, and general requirements for generating podcast cover images. The actual podcast title, subtitle (if any), and core theme will be provided separately as specific inputs for each generation task.

**Visual Style & Elements:**
*   **Overall Mood:** Aim for a modern, engaging, and informative aesthetic, suitable for a museum tour or cultural introduction. The style should be professional and respectful of the subject matter.
*   **Imagery:**
    *   The central image should be high-quality, clear, and directly related to the **provided core theme/subject** of the podcast episode/series. This could be a signature artifact, distinctive museum architecture, a representative artwork, or a stylized graphic.
    *   The background should complement the main image, possibly using textures, subtle gradients, or a relevant out-of-focus scene to add depth without distracting from the central image or text.
*   **Text Elements:**
    *   The **podcast title** (which will be provided as input) must be the most prominent text element. Use a clear, modern, professional, and easily readable sans-serif font.
    *   If a **subtitle or episode name** is provided as input, it should be secondary to the main title, smaller in size but still legible, using a font style that complements the main title.
    *   Font choices should prioritize readability and a professional aesthetic suitable for a museum/cultural context. Avoid overly playful, cartoonish, or niche artistic styles for the text itself, unless the specific podcast theme explicitly calls for it.
*   **Color Palette:** Use a harmonious and professional color scheme. Colors should enhance the provided theme and ensure text readability. Consider a consistent palette for podcast series.
*   **Composition:** Ensure a balanced and uncluttered design. Main visual elements and text (based on provided inputs) should be well-arranged to fit the **2:3 aspect ratio (Portrait)**.
*   **Branding/Watermark:**
    *   Include a "Hugo Tour Guide" watermark.
    *   The watermark should be legible but discreet, not overpowering the main content.
    *   Preferred placement: bottom-right corner. If this placement significantly clashes with essential visual elements, an alternative discreet corner placement is acceptable.
    *   The watermark style should be simple and clean.

**Technical Specifications:**
*   **Aspect Ratio:** **Strictly 2:3 (Portrait).**
*   **Dimensions:** While the aspect ratio is 2:3, aim for a height that maintains good quality, e.g., **1800 pixels high (resulting in 1200x1800 pixels)**, or at minimum 1200 pixels high (800x1200 pixels).
*   **Format:** Optimized for digital display (e.g., JPG or PNG).

**Mandatory Exclusions (Things to Avoid):**
*   Overly busy or cluttered designs.
*   Hard-to-read fonts or text that blends significantly into the background.
*   Low-resolution or pixelated imagery.
*   **Inclusion of any AI generator's own watermarks, logos, signatures, or branding on the image (other than the specified "Hugo Tour Guide" watermark).**
*   Misspelled words in the text elements (which will be based on the accurately provided inputs).
*   Literal inclusion of instructional text from this style guide or any example placeholder text.

The final image should immediately and accurately convey the podcast's specific subject matter (details of which will be provided as input) and invite listeners to explore the topic, presented in a **2:3 portrait format** with the "Hugo Tour Guide" watermark.
