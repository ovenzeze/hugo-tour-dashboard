# Project Standardization Checklist

Please review the following items to ensure project consistency and quality:

1.  **All Copy/Text is in English:**
    *   [ ] Verify that all user-facing text content (UI labels, buttons, messages, alerts, etc.) is in English.
    *   [ ] Ensure any comments or log messages intended for general understanding (not just debug) are also in English if they are part of shared code.

2.  **Code File Length Limit (Max 500 Lines):**
    *   [ ] Check that each individual code file (e.g., `.vue`, `.ts`, `.js`, etc.) does not significantly exceed 500 lines.
    *   [ ] Consider refactoring overly long files into smaller, more manageable modules.

3.  **README Documentation Links are Up-to-Date:**
    *   [ ] Review `README.md` (and any other key documentation files).
    *   [ ] Manually verify that all external links to documentation, resources, or tools are current, not broken, and point to the latest appropriate versions.
    *   [ ] Confirm internal links within the documentation are also correct and functional.
